          <h1><FaAnchor /> Lexical AnchorPoint</h1>
          <p>This plugin aims to provide a drop-in replacement for the Lexical AutoLink plugin included with the Lexical
            React package. This plugin passes the most critical e2e tests of the original AutoLink plugin in only ~100
            lines of <a
              href="https://github.com/redstar504/lexical-anchorpoint/blob/main/src/AnchorPoint/AnchorPointPlugin.tsx">easily
              understandable code</a>.</p>

          <p>Using <a href="https://github.com/redstar504/lexical-anchorpoint/blob/main/src/tests/expectations.ts">regex
            testing</a>,
            combined with a simple aggregate-matching node transformer, it provides a simple way to
            identify and convert URLs within a span of TextNodes into AutoLink nodes. It solves the shortcoming of
            the AutoLink plugin‚Äôs inability to match some obvious URLs. The plugin is largely inspired by the original
            plugin, but at it‚Äôs core, chooses a different approach.</p>

          <p>This project is experimental and likely has a variety of issues. It meets the use case of a simple
            Lexical implementation being developed by the author. You are encouraged to test this plugin thoroughly and
            report any issues in the <a href="http://github.com/redstar504/lexical-anchorpoint">GitHub repository</a>.
            Emails
            have not been tested yet, but you are welcome to clone the repo and try on your own, using the original plugin's regex.</p>

          <h2>Typical Installation</h2>
          <p>Run the following command in your Lexical React project‚Äôs root:</p>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="bash" style={agate} customStyle={{ padding: '1em' }}>
            {`npm i lexical-anchorpoint`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
          <p>Create the matchers, which in this plugin are referred to as anchor points, that specify the URL
            patterns:</p>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="react" style={agate} customStyle={{ padding: '1em' }}>
            {`import { AnchorPointPlugin, createAnchorPoint, DEFAULT_URL_REGEX } from 'lexical-anchorpoint'

const ANCHOR_POINTS = [
  createAnchorPoint(DEFAULT_URL_REGEX, text => {
  return text.startsWith('http') ? text : \`https://\${text}\`})
]`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>

          <p>Nest the plugin as a child of your Lexical Composer component:</p>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="react" style={agate} customStyle={{ padding: '1em' }}>
            {`<AnchorPointPlugin points={ANCHOR_POINTS} />`}

          <h2>Project Details</h2>
          <p>By utilizing a comprehensive Regex pattern, combined with a simple aggregate text-matcher, this
            plugin is able to pass the most critical e2e tests of the original AutoLink plugin, while resolving some of
            the most commonly reported issues.</p>

          <p>There were some tests that were deemed unimportant for the purposes of an early release of this
            implementation, and therefore were not included in this project‚Äôs e2e tests (in fact none have been
            implemented in this repo yet, it was developed against the playground tests and copied over):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <IoIosArrowDroprightCircle />
              We don‚Äôt forcibly ‚Äúdestruct‚Äù links if additional characters are placed before or after the original link
              node. For instance, if you type ‚Äúhttp://example.com‚Äù, and subsequently append a symbol such as ! in front
              of the URL, we do not invalidate the link node. It simply retains the plain-text ! at the beginning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <IoIosArrowDroprightCircle />
              The tests for the inclusion of styling in or around the AutoLink were not thoroughly considered. The
              author intends to spend more time focusing on style applications as those features are necessary, either
              by personal use or community requests.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>This project is in early infancy. It only meets the use case for a project being developed by the author.
            As such, there are likely many edge cases, and bugs that have not been identified. You are encouraged to
            raise an issue to report any problems, or to open a pull request to provide any missing functionality.</p>

          <h2>Additional Information</h2>
          <p>As you probably know, Lexical's React package ships with a plugin called AutoLink. The goal of AutoLink is
            to provide a node
            transformer that transforms any URL like text typed or pasted into the editor into an AutoLink node.</p>

          <p>Several issues have been reported due to the AutoLink plugin‚Äôs inability to match some simple URLs. A
            common example is when typing a URL with a subdomain, such as http://www.google.com in the editor.
            Unfortunately, it does not
            include the `.com` portion as being part of the link (the biggest source of motivation for this
            project).</p>

          <p>The author of this plugin set out to contribute a resolution to the issues identified with the
            AutoLink plugin. After reviewing the variety of PRs that have been raised to solve the popular issues, and
            their corresponding nuances, he determined that it would be easier to rewrite a simple implementation with a
            focus on more powerful regex, combined with a lot less code.</p>

          <p>Perhaps in the future, if this plugin is able to exceed the standards of the original AutoLink plugin in a
            reliably tested fashion, it can be integrated into the core Lexical package.</p>
