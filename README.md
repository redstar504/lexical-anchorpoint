# Lexical AnchorPoint :anchor:

The goal of this plugin is to provide an alternative to the AutoLink plugin distributed with Lexical's React package.

Parts of this plugin are inspired by the AutoLink plugin, however AnchorPoint selectively implements the
behavior provided there, and puts a core focus on matching URLs reliably, through robust regex tests and increased
flexibility.

The AutoLink plugin appeared to have core issues that would need to be reworked from the ground up, so
rather than working on having sweeping changes merged into that package, this repository gives us a centralized place to reimagine
the auto linker from the ground up.

This plugin is in the early stages and does not yet FULLY implement all functionality provided by the original AutoLink
plugin, but it addresses the glaring issues that have been identified repeatedly by the community.

**Note: The initial implementation is a WIP and this plugin is coming soon.**
